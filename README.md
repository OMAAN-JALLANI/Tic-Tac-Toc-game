Here's a step-by-step guide to play Tic-Tac-Toe:

Game Board:

 1 | 2 | 3
  ---------
 4 | 5 | 6
  ---------
 7 | 8 | 9


Gameplay:

1. Player X makes the first move, placing their symbol (X) in one of the nine spaces.
2. Player O makes their move by placing their symbol (O) in an empty space.
3. Players alternate turns.
4. A player cannot place their symbol in a space already occupied by their own symbol or their opponent's symbol.
5. The game is won by the player who gets three of their symbols in a row, either:
    - Horizontally (across a row)
    - Vertically (up or down a column)
    - Diagonally
6. If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw (also known as a "tie" or "stalemate").

How to Make a Move:

1. Choose an empty space on the board.
2. Type the number of that space to place your symbol (X or O).
